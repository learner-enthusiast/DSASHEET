## Learning Tips:

1. **Start with theory** - Understand the data structure/algorithm before jumping to problems
2. **Practice consistently** - Solve 2-3 problems daily
3. **Review and revise** - Revisit solved problems after a week
4. **Mix difficulties** - Don't stick to only easy problems; gradually increase difficulty
5. **Time yourself** - Practice solving problems within time limits
6. **Understand patterns** - Look for common patterns and techniques
7. **Code by hand** - Practice writing code without IDE assistance
8. **Explain your solution** - Be able to explain your approach clearly

**Remember:** This sheet is designed for progressive learning. Each topic builds upon previous knowledge, so follow the order for optimal understanding!
